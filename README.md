# cloudconvert-bot

This Telegram bot mediates between the Telegram servers and those of
cloudconvert.com to provide file conversions in Telegram. It also relies on a
MongoDB hosted at mlab. The code runs on now.

Note that this is a tiny side-project of mine. There is no such thing as
modularity, readability or documentation. Feel free to contribute anyway (if you
dare to dig into it).
