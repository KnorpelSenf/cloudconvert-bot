# cloudconvert-bot

This Telegram bot ([@cloud_convert_bot](https://t.me/cloud_convert_bot)) mediates between the Telegram servers and those of
cloudconvert.com to provide file conversions in Telegram. It also relies on a
Cloud Firestore database. The code runs on GAE.

Please create two bots using [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), one for production and one for development.
The bot runs with webhooks but it will automatically switch to long polling mode if 'dev' is contained in the bot name.
(E. g. the primary test bot is [@cloud_convert_dev_bot](https://t.me/cloud_convert_dev_bot).)
This way, you can host the bot efficiently (webhooks) and still use it locally (long polling).
(I know it would be much nicer to control this via environment variable â€¦ hopefully in the future.)

However, it will always rely on `.env`. The file `.env.production` will be ignored.
You need to exchange them to switch between the bots.

## What else is there to say

There's not too much documentation, but the project is not too complicated anyway IMO.
