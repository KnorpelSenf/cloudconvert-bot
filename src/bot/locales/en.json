However, please remember that this project was created by a single student at Kiel University. Even though I did my best to keep this piece of software free of errors and as reliable as possible, I cannot guarantee that this bot is <i>not accidentally consuming all of your conversion minutes</i>, killing your kitten or the like. It has never happened so far and I consider it highly unlikely, but it is still software, so you never know.

    "helpmsgGroups": "<b>Hi there!</b>\nMy name is Cloud Convert Bot and I can help you with file conversions!\nI will not spam you with any messages or any converted files (unless you ask nicely). There is two ways to tell me that I should convert a file for you:\n  1) <i>Reply</i> to a file someone sends. Reply with the target format directly (e. g. /mp4) or send /convert to see possible formats. I will use the most recent file if you do not hit reply for any message.\n  2) <i>Send a caption</i> when you send the file, e. g. /mp4 to convert to MP4.\n\nOnce the conversion is completed, you can enable <b>auto-conversions</b>. If you enable auto-conversions for a file type, I will automatically repeat this conversion for all files of the same type.\n\n<b>The most awesome feature</b> is that you can set up your own account. This bot can work for some time without an account, but if you use the bot regularly, setting up an account <i>is really important</i> because you can get waaay more free conversions like that. Set it up with /contribute. This way, you can avoid some /limitations and you also contribute to this bot (which is really helpful).\n\nNote that all commands in this group chat need to end on ‚Äú@cloud_convert_bot‚Äù, otherwise I will ignore them (e.g. not /mp4 but /mp4@cloud_convert_bot)!",

    "helpmsgLimitations": "Currently there is <b>two limitations</b>. First: you can only convert a few files a day. Second: you can only convert files up a certain size.\n\nBecause all users of this bot share a common pool of 25 conversions per day and other users can consume your conversions (check the balance with /balance), you sometimes cannot convert any file at all. <b>The good thing</b> is: you simply need to set up an account and BOOM‚Äîthis limit is gone! See /contribute for that!\n\nTelegram does not allow bots (like me) to download files with more than 20 MB in size or upload files with more than 50 MB in size. This limit cannot be changed. If you need to convert larger files, you could visit cloudconvert.com. Sorry!",
    "helpmsgPrivate": "Hi! I am a file converter bot. I support 218 different file formats and I know how to handle media of any kind (<i>audio files</i>, <i>documents</i>, <i>GIFs</i>, <i>photos</i>, <i>stickers</i>, <i>videos</i>, <i>voice notes</i>, and <i>video notes</i>).\n\n<b>IMPORTANT: You can try me out for free.</b> If you need to convert only one file, just go ahead and do it. However, <b>this bot is a community project</b>. If you want to use this bot more often, please contribute by providing an <i>API key</i>: see /contribute. This only takes 30 seconds and it is dead simple. You will be rewarded with 25 free extra-conversions every day. It involves setting up an account. (Don't worry, it is free forever.)\n\nI also support automatic file conversions (even in group chats)! Enable automatic conversions if you have a lot of files of the same type to convert. You can enable auto-conversions as soon as you converted a file.\n\nYou can set the language with /language.\n\nRemember that this bot would not work without the many contributors it has‚Äîbecome one of them! /contribute\n\nDiscussion group: @cloud_convert_bot_lounge\nNews channel: @cloud_convert_bot_news",

All you need to do is to follow these three steps:\n<b>1)</b> Create your own Cloud Convert account <a href=\"https://cloudconvert.com/register\">here</a>.\n<b>2)</b> Visit the <a href=\"https://cloudconvert.com/dashboard/api/v1/keys\">dashboard</a> and copy the API key.\n<b>3)</b> Get back to this chat and send /apikey. Paste the API key into this chat.\nGood job! Now every single operation of this bot will work based on your new Cloud Convert account! Resetting the bot with /reset clears the API key from our database. Once you sent me your API key, I will tell you a secret bot command as a thank-you gift!\n\nPlease note that neither this bot nor its dev are in any way associated with cloudconvert.com. The people behind that site just offer free file conversions and they have a neat way to connect bots to that service. They're based in Munich, Germany and you do not need to worry about privacy concerns or ads or \"we miss you\" bullshit once you signed up.
